# 🧠 Sentiment Analyzer

A beginner-friendly **Python project** that reads your text and predicts whether the sentiment is **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** using a library called **TextBlob**.  
This is a great first project to learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Python programming!

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The program takes any sentence or review as input.  
2. It calculates a **polarity score** using TextBlob:
   - Positive → 😊
   - Negative → 😠
   - Neutral → 😐  
3. The output is shown instantly in the terminal.
